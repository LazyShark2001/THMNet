# üìñ Introduction
<span style="font-size: 125%">
Salient object detection (SOD) plays a crucial role in the intelligent interpretation of remote sensing tasks. Significant advancements have been made with SOD methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers. However, the structural differences and complex topological relationships presented by diverse remote sensing scenes often limit SOD performance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel method for SOD in remote sensing images (RSI) called topology-aware hierarchical Mamba network (THMNet), which fully utilizes the Mamba‚Äôs advantages in global modeling and linear computation. Specifically, a grouped Mamba topology enhancement module is designed to extract high-level semantic features and improve the global representation of structural information for salient objects. Furthermore, a hierarchy Mamba segmentation optimization (HMSO) module is introduced, which employs the prior guidance to adaptively focus on the foreground and background at different levels. This module reduces the processing of noncritical information within complex topological relationships and enhances the capture and depiction of intricate objects. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms mainstream CNNs- and Transformers-based SOD techniques, effectively detecting salient objects in complex backgrounds.
